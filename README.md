*DISCRIPTION*: This document outlines the development of an E-commerce application using .NET 8, MVC architecture, and Entity Framework Core.
               The application features user authentication with ASP.NET Core Identity, role-based access control, product management with CRUD operations, 
               shopping cart functionalities, and order processing including checkout and order history. Product details such as name, description, 
               price, and image are managed through the product management module. The shopping cart allows users to add, update, and remove items, 
               providing a seamless shopping experience. The database design includes tables for users, products, categories, carts, orders, 
               and order details with defined relationships between them. The application follows the MVC pattern to separate concerns, and Razor views are 
               used for the front-end, leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design. It is designed for deployment on IIS, Azure, or other compatible environments, 
               with security measures like data protection, input validation, and secure authentication. The application ensures a scalable and maintainable architecture 
               for managing online retail operations.
